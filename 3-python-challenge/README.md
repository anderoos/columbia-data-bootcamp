# CU-3-Python-Challenge

## Description
This challenge project is used to apply what we've learned in the few weeks from bootcamp. Here, we are presented with two python challenges:
* PyBank
* Pypoll

These tasks represents real world situations where we can apply python scripting to analyze datasets.
    
### PyBank
In this project, we're provided with a list of financial records of a company, budget_data.csv and are tasked with finding:
* Total months of months
* Profit/losses per month
* Profit/losses over the entire period
* Period of greatest gains
* Period of greatest losses
### PyPoll
In this project, we're provided a list of polling results for a small rural town, election_data.csv. We are tasks with modernizing this process by creating a script that:
* Find total number of votes cast
* Complete list of candidates
* Percentages of votes each candidiate won
* Total votes for each candidate
* Winner of election based on popular vote

## Approaches and Resources
Using knowledge taken from class and my previous python experience, I created a function that takes a DictReader object from the csv module and performs the analysis based on the asks above. I prefer using dictionaries over lists becauase they are more memory efficient and can be called using their respective column labels. Insights into the logic of my code can be found in the comments of my main.py file for each project.

## Features
Uses functions so different datasets can be fed into these scripts.

## Licensing
This code has no license restrictions. Challenge files are provided by Columbia School of Engineering.
